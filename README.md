# ClosenessCentrality
Use Floyd Shortest Path to commute closeness centrality, and add duplicated nodes weight depend on the number of occurrences  
# Input format:  
List of String[2], every String represent a edge, they can be phone number or id. examples can see testclose.java  
# output format:  
Map of nodes,key is set of your input Strings, value is ... something based on closeness centrality.  
# Nodes  
If you want the original closeness centrality, you can delete the iteration of sigmoid part and the map of countTimes. or you can derectly refer my reference git project.
